# Challenge-02 - Marketing Website


## Marketing Agency Home Webpage Improvement

## My Why?

- The motive to this website is to being awareness to the Marketing Company while learning the importance of clear concise HTML and CSS code.

-  This project was created to have a home page of a Marketing agency and share the offering of this business. It also brings awareness to the marketing company. On the code side it has clear semantic elements to clearly describe the content. Therefore, for future improvements to this website the next developer will clear understand the code and the layout. This is done by placing the correct HTML semantics. Furthermore, creating descriptive elements and image alt description are important to the developer and the end user. Lastly creating and using repetitive code throughout HTML and CSS file should be revised to capture it in one section and call it and not be required to rewrite the code again in other sections.
